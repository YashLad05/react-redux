Reducers - How to do?

In this folder, we can create Multiple Reducers
Name of reducer will be the .js file Name

In our Example -
"upDown" is reducer name and "upDown.js" is that reducer file

When "Action" and "Reducer" are created,
then we need "Store"
For Store, we need only store.js file in src folder.
